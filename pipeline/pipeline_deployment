# The following commands will launch the Cloudformation stack and the corresponding
# role that is required to manage the application pipeline. It is important that the
# project name used be consistent in both, and that the role be created first.

# The following command creates a role that can be assumed by CloudFormation
# in order to create and update the stack defined in the code template.

# This role is created outside of the stack created by the pipeline.yaml 
# template file, however, the two work in tandem with one another.

# The role is created outside of the stack since permissions that are
# neccessary to launch each cloudformation stack may be different, and 
# can be configured individually. 

# In order for the stack to locate the role, the proper naming convention
# must be followed. Replace <project-name> with the same value that is used for
# the ProjectName parameter in the corresponding CloudFormation stack.

# The following command will launch the CloudFormation stack that will create
# the pipeline for the application stack.

# The following command is assumed to be run in the same directory as the
# pipeline.yaml file. If run from a different directory, the path in the
# --template-file option must be changed.

# The <project-name> placeholder must be changed to the name of the project
# That the pipeline will deploy and manage. It is important that the same 
# value used for the project name in the above command be used for the 
# project name in the pipeline creation command below

# The <root-template-file> placeholder must be changed to a string that
# represents that path to the main cloudformation template in the
# infrastructure directory of the project, e.g. if the main template
# is located at infrastructure/main/template.yaml, this value would be set 
# to main/template.yaml
